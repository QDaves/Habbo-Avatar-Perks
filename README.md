The Habbo Avatar Perks extension is a tool that allows users to gain access to premium avatar features and benefits on Habbo Hotel websites without owning the required Collectibles.

Here's how it works:

1. **Verification**:
When the "Get Avatar Perks" button is clicked, the extension sends the nonce to my backend server at bobba.pro

2. **Nonce Generation and Signing**:
Upon receiving the nonce, my backend server signes it with a address (which contains the necessary premium Collectibles) using my private key, generating a cryptographic signature. This generated signature is then sent back to the extension.

3. **API Call**:
The extension uses the received signature to make an API call to the Habbo servers, falsely representing ownership of a Avatar Collectible.

4. **Access to Avatar Perks**:
If the API call is successful, the Habbo servers are tricked into believing that the user owns the Collectibles from me.
This grants you access to special avatar accessories, exclusive HC/BC Perks, and other benefits typically reserved for actual Collectible owners.

In summary, the extension leverages blockchain signatures from my backend server (which legitimately holds the Habbo Collectibles) to spoof ownership for you, allowing to bypass purchasing expensive Collectibles while still enjoying the same premium perks.
